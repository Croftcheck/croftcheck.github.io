      <h2>Sample Two: Riker is the Worst TNG Character.</h2>
      <p>The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores,
        cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.
        Computer, belay that order. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. </p>
      <p>Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere
        fast. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? I
        guess it's better to be lucky than good. and attack the Romulans. Sorry, Data. You enjoyed
        that. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?</p>
      <p>I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity,
         but I am not insane. Your shields were failing, sir. Not if I weaken first. Wait a
         minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I can't.
         As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. My oath is between
         Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or
         do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Flair is what marks the
         difference between artistry and mere competence.</p>
      <p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.
        When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? In all trust, there
        is the possibility for betrayal. What? We're not at all alike! Maybe if we felt
         any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history
         would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi,
         or Worf. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf,
         I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Yesterday I did not know h
         ow to eat gagh. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant
         to be in two places at once. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.
         Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? </p>
      <p>Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine.</p>
