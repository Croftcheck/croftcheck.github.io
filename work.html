      <h2>Work Samples</h2>
      <p>My writing experience has come from a wealth of different sources. I've been a laborer, an administrative assistant, a courier, quality control, a manager, an official, and a technical writer. Barring one of those, few of my jobs were focused on writing. As such, my samples are an eclectic bunch. Three of them can be found on the sidebar to the right.</p>
      <p>Among the documentation I've created are assembly instructions for machinery, cable routing (name from work), quick reference guides, and troubleshooting documents. I have worked with multiple Department of Defense weapons systems' documentation, written and compiled workshop proceedings, and taken meeting minutes. Some of these are available upon request; others are under NDAs or otherwise barred from easy access.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Sample One is (title). I wrote it for (company or reason) , in (date).</li>
      <li>Sample Two is (title). This one was written on (date) for (company or reason).</li>
      <li>Sample Three is "Hooked on Lorain County," a blog I wrote while interning for the Lorain County Visitor's Bureau in 2012.</li>
      </ul>
