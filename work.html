      <h2>Work Samples</h2>
      <p>My writing experience has come from a wealth of different sources. I've been a laborer, an administrative assistant, a courier, quality control, a manager, an official, and a technical writer. Barring one of those, few of my jobs were focused on writing. As such, my samples are an eclectic bunch. Three of them can be found on the sidebar to the right.</p>
      <p>Among the documentation I've created are assembly instructions for machinery, cable routing instructions, quick reference guides, and troubleshooting documents. I have worked with multiple Department of Defense weapons systems' documentation, written and compiled workshop proceedings, and taken meeting minutes. Some of these are available upon request; others are under NDAs or otherwise barred from easy access.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p><a href="sample-one.html">Sample One</a> contains PDFs of projects I worked on at Kratos. One of them is a marketing flyer, on which I provided copy, editing, and some design assistance. The other file is a template for a checklist, to be used in Microsoft Word.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="sample-two.html">Sample Two</a> is a review for <span class="underline">XCOM: Enemy Within</span>. This one was written, shortly after the game's release, for an upcoming video game website that failed to launch.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="sample-three.html">Sample Three</a> is "Hooked on Lorain County," a blog I wrote while interning for the Lorain County Visitor's Bureau in 2012.</p></li>
