      <h2>Sample One: War of the Worlds, I guess</h2>
      <p>At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested.
        Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there
        were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and
        the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.</p>
      <p>It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, w
        here some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike
        into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile, and,
        crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed near several
        farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn.  He saw
        few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened
        upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them
        just in time to save them.</p>
      <p>He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple
        of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which
        they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened
        pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was
        simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man
        who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.</p>
      <p>My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried
        towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,
        and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was
        unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent
        him down against the wheel of the chaise.</p>
      <p>It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a
        kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm.
       He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third
       antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched
       himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come.</p>
      <p>"Take this!" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her revolver.</p>
