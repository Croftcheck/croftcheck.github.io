        <h2>Sample Three: Whedon Stuff Here</h2>
        <p> I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal. We attack
           the mayor with hummus. I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic
            lowlife community. Woman, you are completely off your nut. Okay, at this
            point you're abusing sarcasm. First of all, Feng Shui up the yin yang, also
            I designed parts of it but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small
            clothes and the ample massage facilities. I don't buckle. Occasionally I
            swashbuckle. </p>
        <p> All monkeys are French. You didn't know that? It's not a road trip. It's
          a covert operation. I like to think of myself more as a 'guest-age'. She is
          the slayer. Shh! No programs, don't use that word. Just be Buffy. </p>
        <p> I figure, if I'm responsible for the end of the world, I get to name it.
           Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm. I'm not planning on presiding
           over the end of Western Civilization. Well we could grind our enemies into
            talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night. I'll
            never leave. Not even if you kill me. </p>
        <p> Wash, we've got some local color happening. Someone else's loss is my
          chocolatey goodness. And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey
          pants!' Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a
          nice crypt. Everybody started singing and dancing. That girl will rain destruction
          down on you and your ship. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and
          turn into an enormous green rage monster. She is the slayer. </p>
        <p> Okay, uh, I'm lost. I'm angry. And I'm armed. The human body can be drained
          of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. </p>
        <p> Everyone's a hero in their own way, in their own not that heroic way. I
          don't want to use the word genius, but I'd be ok if you wanted to. Did you
          know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the
          monkey? Can I start getting sexed already? I thought all children despise
          effort and enjoy cartoons. </p>
        <p> Little man loved fire. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair.
          It's a toss-up. It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog.
           I've seen your kindness and your strength. They rampaged through half the
           known world until Angel got his soul. Some terrifying space monkeys maybe
           got loose? I am never gonna see a merman, ever. </p>
        <p> This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it?
          You can't take the sky from me. You'll prove I can trust you when the day
          comes that you have to kill me. And you do. The brain is kept in a fear-induced,
          adrenaline-fueled overdrive state, like a problem you can't solve. You're really
          campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you? What gives you the right to suck
          face with your demon lover again? In the time of gods and monsters, what is the
          worth of a man? You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake
          up and smell the hottie. </p>
