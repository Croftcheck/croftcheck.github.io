      <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I don't know what you're talking about.
         I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I
          want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to
          learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
      <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old
        master. You mean it controls your actions? I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
         Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
      <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Don't underestimate the
        Force. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding
        their secret base. What?! You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
