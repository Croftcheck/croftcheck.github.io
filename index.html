      <h2>My story.</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Miami University's University Honors Program with a double-major
        in English and Psychology. I am a storyteller at heart. I became an English major
        because of the way that it ties stories to life. If it has been experienced, chances
        are it has been written about. Stories are how we connect to other people. We tell
        each other stories about what happened, how it made us feel, why we acted the way we did.
        Marketing and sales are telling the story of a product. News is telling the story of what's
        going on right now. Publishing is literally spreading stories to the world. Human
        resources is the interweaving of the company's story and those of its current and future employees.</p>
      <p>Storytelling is an art. In order to be successful, the stories one tells must be
        memorable. A story should strike the audience, grab them and not let go. It is a
         means of connecting with people, recognizing that they are indeed people and not
         just consumers or data points.What is business, if not interacting with people? A
         storyteller is someone able to interact at any level--from the executive to the
          cleaning crew to the end-user. Through the use of various programs, such as the
          Microsoft Office Suite, a storyteller can mold and adapt the story, in order to
           best reach their audience. I can use Microsoft Dynamics to find sales and inventory
            numbers, and run statistical analysis on them with SPSS. The presentation, the story,
            is made as strongly as it needs to be.</p>
      <p>A story is not static, and a storyteller cannot be either. As I teach myself HTML,
        I garner new methods of finding and presenting information. New stories are growing
         everyday, alongside new methods to tell them. Technology is evolving, and so too are
         our stories. Let me help you tell yours.</p>
      <p>I am a storyteller.</p>
